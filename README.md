## Summary: 
This project is an example UI for an app that tracks potential acquisitions. Customers can create 'Targets' to track these potential acquisitions. They can also update, delete, and view a detailed breakdown of the Target's financial stats, workflow status (Pending, In Review, Approved, etc.), and contact details for their representative at the Target company.
